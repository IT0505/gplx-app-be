2. Open any MySQL GUI (We recommend using MySQL Workbench) and create an empty schema.

    - spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:`PORT`/`schema_name` (`PORT` is the port your MySQL runs on, default is 3306. `schema_name` is the name of the schema you created in step 2)  
    - spring.datasource.username=`your_mysql_username`  
    - spring.datasource.password=`your_mysql_password`  
5. Save all your changes and run the project. It will run on default `PORT` which is 8080.
